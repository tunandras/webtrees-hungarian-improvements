# Webtrees—Hungarian improvements
These are modified PHP files—containing improvements mostly to display on-screen names in localized order if language is Hungarian and they include some text adjustments as well. At last but not at least there are some changes in “hu.po” Hungarian translation file—thanks to Gyönyör János (published by <a href="https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/commit/e1c58e6fe3d32e19454598497bbc67d6b749d957" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab.">fisharebest</a> on October 7).

# Installation / Usage
<ul>
  <li>First—for security reasons—save your affected original “.php” and “hu.po” files.</li>
  <li>Download listed files above to your computer.</li>
  <li>Convert downoaded “hu.po” file to “hu.mo” with a converter (for example <a href="http://poedit.net/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab.">Poedit</a> or <a href="https://weblate.org/en/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab.">Weblate</a>) and upload it to your_folder/language/ folder on the server.</li>
  <li>Then upload the PHP files overwriting the originals in the relevant folders on the server.</li>
  <li>If you are not satisfied with the result, you can return to the original saved files by replacing the new ones.</li>
</ul>
