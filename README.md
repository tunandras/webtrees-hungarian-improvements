# webtrees-improvements
These are modified PHP files–containing improvements mostly to display on-screen names in localized order if language is Hungarian and they include some text adjustments as well. At last but not at least there are some changes in the Hungarian translation file–thanks to Gyönyör János (published by a month ago).
